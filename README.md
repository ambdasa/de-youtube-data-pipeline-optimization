# 🎥 **YouTube Data Pipeline Optimization - AWS** 🚀

## 📝 **Project Overview**

This project focuses on securely managing, streamlining, and analyzing **YouTube videos data** using AWS services, including both structured and semi-structured formats. It emphasizes video categories, trending metrics, and audience engagement to derive actionable insights.

### **Objective:**
To create a **cloud-based data pipeline** that extracts, transforms, and loads (ETL) YouTube video data using AWS services like **Amazon S3**, **AWS Glue**, **AWS Lambda**, and **Amazon Athena** for querying, and **Amazon QuickSight** for visualizing data.

## 📊 **Data Flow**

1. **Data Ingestion** from YouTube data sources via API into **Amazon S3**.
2. **ETL Processing** using **AWS Glue** for cleaning, transforming, and enriching data.
3. **Serverless Data Processing** with **AWS Lambda** to handle real-time data events.
4. **Efficient Data Querying** with **Amazon Athena** to analyze large datasets stored in **S3**.
5. **Interactive Visualizations** via **Amazon QuickSight** for better insights and decision-making.

## 🔑 **Key Features**

- **Scalable Data Storage**: Efficiently stores and manages large volumes of YouTube data in **S3**.  
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans and structures raw YouTube data using **AWS Glue**.  
- **Serverless Computing**: Uses **AWS Lambda** to process data without worrying about infrastructure.  
- **Fast Querying**: Queries large datasets using **Amazon Athena** directly from **S3**.  
- **Insights & Reporting**: Visualizes video performance using **Amazon QuickSight** dashboards.

---

## 🧩 **Lessons Learned**

- **Scalability in Cloud**: Leveraging **AWS S3** and **Athena** for querying allowed the system to scale seamlessly, even with large datasets.
- **Optimizing ETL Processes**: **AWS Glue** provided an efficient and flexible way to manage ETL tasks, but careful management of **crawler frequency** and **partitioning** was crucial for optimized performance.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Using **AWS Lambda** helped reduce costs and improve the system's efficiency by automating event-driven tasks.
- **Data Quality & Cleanliness**: Handling raw YouTube data with inconsistent formats highlighted the importance of effective **data cleaning** and **validation** before analytics.

## 📈 **Data & Visualization Strategy**

The dataset used for this project comes from **Kaggle**, containing **daily trending YouTube video statistics** across various regions. The dataset includes critical metrics such as:

- Video titles 🎬
- Channel information 📺
- Publication times ⏰
- Views, likes, dislikes 👍👎
- Engagement statistics 💬

Through **Amazon QuickSight**, I have developed **interactive dashboards** that provide stakeholders with valuable insights into video performance, trending patterns, and audience behavior.

## 🌐 **Getting Started**

### **Setup AWS Environment**

1. **Create an S3 Bucket** to store the YouTube data:
   - Go to the **AWS S3 Console**.
   - Create a bucket, e.g., `my-youtube-data-bucket`.

2. **Set up AWS Glue** to crawl and transform the data:
   - Navigate to the **AWS Glue Console**.
   - Create a **Crawler** to scan the data stored in S3.
   - Set the crawler to run and populate the **Glue Data Catalog** with the metadata.

3. **Deploy AWS Lambda Functions** for serverless processing:
   - Go to the **AWS Lambda Console** and create a new function.
   - Configure the function to trigger based on data in **S3** or other event sources (e.g., file uploads).
   - Use Lambda for processing tasks like cleaning and enriching the data.

4. **Use Amazon Athena** for querying data from S3:
   - In the **Athena Console**, set up a **database** using the Glue Data Catalog.
   - Query the YouTube data directly from **S3** using **SQL**.

5. **Visualize insights using Amazon QuickSight**:
   - Go to **Amazon QuickSight** and create a **new dataset** from Athena.
   - Build interactive **dashboards** and visualizations to explore trends, video performance, and audience engagement.
