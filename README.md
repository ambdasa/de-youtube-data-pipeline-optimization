YouTube Data Pipeline Optimization

Data Engineering YouTube Analysis Project

This project focuses on securely managing, streamlining, and analyzing YouTube videos data, encompassing both structured and semi-structured formats, with a specific emphasis on video categories and trending metrics.

**Project Overview: YouTube Data Analytics Pipeline**
This YouTube data analytics project is a comprehensive cloud-based solution designed to transform raw video data into meaningful insights using AWS services. By leveraging Amazon S3 for scalable storage, AWS Glue for ETL processes, AWS Lambda for serverless computing, and Amazon Athena for efficient querying, I have created a robust data pipeline that can handle large volumes of structured and semi-structured YouTube video data. The system will securely ingest, process, and store information from multiple sources, ensuring data integrity and accessibility

**Data and Visualization Strategy**
In this project I have utilized a rich Kaggle dataset containing daily trending YouTube video statistics across various regions, capturing critical metrics such as video titles, channel information, publication times, views, likes, dislikes, and engagement statistics. Through Amazon QuickSight, I have developed interactive dashboards that transform complex data into actionable visualizations, enabling stakeholders to gain deep insights into video performance, trending patterns, and audience behavior. My approach emphasizes scalability, security, and comprehensive data management, making it a powerful tool for understanding YouTube video dynamics.
